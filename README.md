A starter plugin for extending Pods' functionality.

Instructions
============

You will need to change the name of the plugin in a few simple steps:

Rename the base plugin folder name and primary PHP file named 'pods-extend.php' to your plugin's name. Make sure the folder name matches the name of the PHP file (without .php on the end).
Search for 'pods-extend' and replace with your desired plugin name in all lowercase with dashes between words (if desired).
Search for 'Pods Starter Plugin' and replace with your plugin's proper name.
Search for 'Pods_Extend' and replace with your plugin's proper name with underscores instead of spaces between words.
